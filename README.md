# Weather-Dashboard

When a user searches for a city, they are presented with the current and future weather conditions for that city and is added to their search history. The output includes the city name, the date, windspeed, temperature, humidity levels and the UV index. The UV index changes color based on the index level ( favorable: green, moderate: yellow,  severe: red). In the five day forecast, the user is presented with the temperature, wind speed, and the humidity. When a user clicks on a city in the search history, they are NOT presented with the weather conditions for that city.
